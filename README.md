# SkyrimAlchemyJS
JavaScript web site for calculating alchemical effects for Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim after the Unofficial Patch.

Can currently do the following:
* Filter by ingredient effect and DLC (Downloadable Content).
* Sort by ingredient name.
* Calculate the resulting potion/poison of the 2-3 ingredients mixed together as well as it's magnitude, duration and gold cost. 
* Displaying other possible combinations (if you select three ingredients).

What I'm working on:
* Styling the website.
* Making the website into a webapp.
* Allowing the user to filter ingredients by the location they're found.
* Allowing the user to sort ingredients by multipliers.
* Displaying multipliers.
