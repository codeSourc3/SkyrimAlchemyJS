# SkyrimAlchemyJS
JavaScript PWA (Progressive Web Application) for calculating alchemical effects for Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim after the Unofficial Patch.

Can currently do the following:
* Filter by ingredient effect and DLC (Downloadable Content).
* Calculate the resulting potion/poison of the 2-3 ingredients mixed together as well as it's magnitude, duration and gold cost. 
* Displaying other possible combinations (if you select three ingredients).
* Run offline once installed.

What I'm working on:
* Adding Skyrim: Anniversary Edition ingredients
* Allowing the user to filter ingredients by the location they're found.
* Adding Alchemy Helper Mode to calculate the most valuable ingredient combinations from what is in your inventory.
* Fixing WAI-ARIA (web accessibility) for the web app
